# ML-python-lightgbm-cpu-training


Quickstart project for executing an Iris classifier using the LightGBM framework on a CPU.

This Quickstart trains the model and persists as in ONNX format. The service runtime will then serve the model on localhost where the user can then send GET requests to perform inference.
